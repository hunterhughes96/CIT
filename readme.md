# How To Get Back Into Your Passcode Locked iPhone

By Hunter Hughes

Many iPhone users have been in the predicament where the passcode used to get into the phone is entered incorrectly too many times. Each time this happens consecutively, it will disable the phone for increasing amounts of time, until eventually you are permanently locked out of the phone. No problem, right? I'll just plug my phone into iTunes and restore it! However, youll notice upon plugging it in that iTunes will not recognize the phone.

*What do I do now?*

Well, you'll have to know how to put the phone into  **recovery mode**  before you can restore it and get back into it. This tutorial will show you how to do this to your phone, in the event your little brother thinks it'd be funny to permanently disable your device.

The intended audience is iPhone owners, especially those that consider themselves "not tech savvy".

Remember, before you restore your phone, you <u>must absolutely</u> know your apple ID and password associated with the phone, as it will prompt you for it before allowing you back into your device.


## First Step

Now, the first step is identifying your model of iPhone. This is important, as depending on whether or not you have a physical home button, the methods will be different. If you are unsure about your model of iPhone, you can run the serial or IMEI number through apple's website,  [https://checkcoverage.apple.com/](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/)

The IMEI number on iphone 7 and newer can be found by popping out the SIM card tray, on which one side the number is printed.

For iPhones older than the iPhone 7, the serial or IMEI number is printed on the back.



## iPhone 6s or Earlier

1.  Connect your iPhone to a computer and launch iTunes.
2.  Power down the device *completely.*
3.  Press and hold the <b>home</b> and <b>lock</b> buttons (the lock button is on the side in the iPhone 6 or later, or on top of the device on the iPhone 5s and earlier).
4.  Keep holding the buttons, even when you see the apple logo.
5.  Release the buttons once you see the <b>Recovery Mode</b> screen.

## iPhone 7/7+

1.  Connect your iPhone to a computer and launch iTunes.
2.  Power down the device *completely.*
3.  Press and hold the <b>side button</b> and <b>volume down</b> button at the same time.
4.  Keep holding the buttons, even when you see the apple logo.
5.  Release the buttons once you see the <strong>Recovery Mode</strong> screen.

This one, I like to call the Konami Code. Timing is involved, which makes it *potentially* a bit trickier, but don't give up hope if you don't get it the first time!

1.  Connect your iPhone to a computer and launch iTunes.
2.  Power down the device *completely.*
3.  Press the **volume up** button.
4.  immediately after, release the first button and press the **volume down** button.
5.  immediately after, release the second button, and press and hold the **side button.**
6.  Keep holding the button, even when you see the apple logo.
7.  Release the buttons once you see the <b>Recovery Mode</b> screen.

## The Final Step
Now that your phone is in recovery mode, timing is important, as it will only stay in this mode for 15 minutes. 
Go back to your computer with iTunes opened, and you will now see this message:

At this point, you can either **restore** from a backup stored on your computer if you know the passcode, or you can **restore** to factory defaults if you don't know the passcode.

**Do not simply update the phone, as you will still be locked out.**

At this point it will most likely have to download the latest iOS which can sometimes take over 15 minutes, thus kicking you out of the restore if passing that frame of time. If this happens, go through the above steps again, and when hitting **restore** the second time, it will continue downloading from where it left off.

If all the above steps were correctly followed, All you have to do walk through the steps to set your phone back up and you are good to go!
